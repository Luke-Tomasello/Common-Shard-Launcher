# Common-Shard-Launcher
This is the launcher used for both Angel Island and Siege Perilous. You can add any other shards to it as well.

# Work you'll need to do
The launcher currently points at our private server for downloads, patches, and UI graphics. Pointing these to your own server should be easy enough.
